**1. Question:** Explain the concept of change detection in Angular and how you optimize it for performance.
   **Answer:** Change detection is the mechanism Angular uses to update the DOM when the component's data changes. Angular's default strategy checks every component for changes on every event, which can be inefficient. Optimization involves using `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`, which only checks for changes when the input properties change or when an event is triggered explicitly. We can also use `trackBy` in `ngFor` to prevent unnecessary DOM updates.

**2. Question:** Describe the Angular lifecycle hooks and provide examples of when you'd use each.
   **Answer:** Lifecycle hooks are events that Angular triggers during a component's lifecycle.
   * `ngOnChanges`: Responds when Angular sets or resets data-bound input properties. (Used for input changes)
   * `ngOnInit`: Called once, after the first `ngOnChanges`. (Used for initialization)
   * `ngDoCheck`: Called during every change detection run. (Used for custom change detection)
   * `ngAfterContentInit`: Called after content projection. (Used for working with projected content)
   * `ngAfterViewInit`: Called after the component's view and child views are initialized. (Used for DOM manipulation)
   * `ngOnDestroy`: Called just before Angular destroys the component. (Used for cleanup)

**3. Question:** Explain the differences between reactive forms and template-driven forms, and when would you choose each?
   **Answer:**
   * Reactive forms: Declarative, more scalable, and testable. They are defined in the component class. (Used for complex forms with dynamic behavior).
   * Template-driven forms: Simple, suitable for basic forms. They are defined primarily in the template. (Used for simple forms).

**4. Question:** How do you handle asynchronous operations in Angular, and what are your preferred methods?
   **Answer:** We handle asynchronous operations using:
   * Observables (RxJS): Preferred for their powerful operators and ability to handle complex asynchronous flows.
   * Promises: Useful for single asynchronous operations.
   * `async/await`: Modern JavaScript syntax for cleaner asynchronous code.
   * HTTP client.

**5. Question:** Describe your experience with state management in Angular. What tools or patterns have you used, and why?
   **Answer:** I've used:
   * NgRx: For complex applications requiring predictable state management. It provides a centralized store, actions, reducers, and effects.
   * Akita: Simpler than NgRx, suitable for many applications, with a focus on simplicity and developer experience.
   * Services with RxJS BehaviorSubjects: For simpler state management in smaller applications.
   * I choose based on project complexity and team familiarity.

**6. Question:** Explain the concept of lazy loading in Angular and its benefits.
   **Answer:** Lazy loading loads modules or components only when they are needed. Benefits include:
   * Improved initial load time.
   * Reduced bundle size.
   * Better performance for large applications.

**7. Question:** How do you handle cross-browser compatibility issues in your Angular applications?
   **Answer:**
   * Using polyfills for missing browser features.
   * Testing on multiple browsers and devices.
   * Using CSS prefixes for vendor-specific properties.
   * Utilizing tools like Autoprefixer and BrowserStack.
   * Following web standards.

**8. Question:** Discuss your experience with Angular CLI and how it improves development efficiency.
   **Answer:** Angular CLI streamlines development by:
   * Generating components, services, and modules.
   * Running development servers.
   * Building and deploying applications.
   * Automating testing.

**9. Question:** How do you implement and manage security in Angular applications, especially regarding authentication and authorization?
   **Answer:**
   * Using JWT for authentication.
   * Implementing role-based authorization.
   * Protecting against XSS and CSRF attacks.
   * Using HTTPS for secure communication.
   * Storing tokens securely.

**10. Question:** Explain the concept of Angular decorators and provide examples of common decorators.
   **Answer:** Decorators are functions that modify classes, methods, properties, or parameters.
   * `@Component`: Defines a component.
   * `@Directive`: Defines a directive.
   * `@Injectable`: Marks a class as available for dependency injection.
   * `@Input` and `@Output`: Define input and output properties.

**11. Question:** How do you write unit tests and end-to-end tests for Angular applications? What tools do you use?
   **Answer:**
   * Unit tests: Using Jasmine and Karma.
   * End-to-end tests: Using Protractor or Cypress.
   * Mocking dependencies for isolated testing.
   * Testing component logic, services, and interactions.

**12. Question:** Describe the concept of dependency injection in Angular and its benefits.
   **Answer:** Dependency injection is a design pattern that provides dependencies to a class instead of creating them within the class. Benefits include:
   * Improved testability.
   * Increased code reusability.
   * Decoupled components.

**13. Question:** How do you optimize the performance of Angular applications, particularly regarding rendering and data fetching?
   **Answer:**
   * Using `OnPush` change detection.
   * Lazy loading modules.
   * Using `trackBy` in `ngFor`.
   * Memoization.
   * Optimizing HTTP requests.
   * Virtual scrolling for large lists.

**14. Question:** Explain the concept of Angular directives and provide examples of structural and attribute directives.
   **Answer:** Directives extend HTML capabilities.
   * Structural directives: Modify the DOM structure (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`).
   * Attribute directives: Change the appearance or behavior of an element (e.g., `[ngStyle]`, `[ngClass]`).

**15. Question:** How do you handle errors in Angular applications, both client-side and server-side?
   **Answer:**
   * Using `try...catch` blocks for client-side errors.
   * Implementing error handling in HTTP services using RxJS `catchError`.
   * Displaying user-friendly error messages.
   * Logging errors for debugging.
   * Setting up global error handlers.

**16. Question:** Explain the concept of observables in RxJS and how they differ from promises.
   **Answer:** Observables are used to handle asynchronous data streams.
   * Observables can emit multiple values over time.
   * Observables are cancellable.
   * Promises emit a single value or an error.
   * Observables are lazy, promises are not.

**17. Question:** How do you manage and optimize CSS in Angular applications, especially with large projects?
   **Answer:**
   * Using component-scoped CSS.
   * Using CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less.
   * Utilizing CSS modules.
   * Following a consistent naming convention (BEM, SMACSS).
   * Using a CSS framework.

**18. Question:** Describe your experience with server-side rendering (SSR) in Angular and its benefits.
   **Answer:** SSR renders Angular applications on the server before sending them to the client. Benefits include:
   * Improved SEO.
   * Faster initial load time.
   * Better performance on slow devices.
   * Using Angular Universal.

**19. Question:** How do you handle internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) in Angular applications?
   **Answer:**
   * Using Angular's i18n module.
   * Extracting text into translation files.
   * Using locale-specific formatting for dates and numbers.
   * Using external libraries for complex localization.

**20. Question:** Describe a challenging Angular project you worked on and how you overcame the obstacles.
   **Answer:** (Prepare a specific project example). I worked on a large e-commerce platform that had performance issues due to heavy data rendering. We implemented `OnPush` change detection, lazy loading, and optimized data fetching using RxJS. We refactored the state management to use Akita, which simplified state updates and improved performance. We also added virtual scrolling for large product lists. This resulted in a significantly faster and more responsive application.
