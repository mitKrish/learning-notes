Let's dive deep into JavaScript object prototypes.  This is a core concept for understanding how inheritance and object creation work in JavaScript.

**What is a Prototype?**

Every object in JavaScript has a *prototype*.  Think of it as a blueprint or a parent object.  The prototype is itself an object, and it can also have its own prototype, creating a chain. This chain is called the *prototype chain*.

**Why Prototypes?**

Prototypes enable *inheritance* in JavaScript.  Objects can inherit properties and methods from their prototype.  This avoids code duplication and allows you to create hierarchies of objects.

**How Prototypes Work**

1. **`__proto__` (Deprecated but Important for Understanding):**  Historically, you could access an object's prototype using the `__proto__` property (double underscore proto double underscore).  While this is now largely deprecated in modern code (for direct access), it's crucial for understanding the underlying mechanism.  `object.__proto__` points to the prototype of `object`.

2. **`Object.getPrototypeOf()`:** The modern and preferred way to access an object's prototype is using the `Object.getPrototypeOf(object)` method.

3. **The Prototype Chain:** When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for that property directly on the object itself. If it doesn't find it, it goes up the prototype chain to the object's prototype.  It continues searching up the chain until it finds the property or reaches the end (which is usually `null`).  If it reaches `null`, the property is considered undefined.

4. **`constructor` Property:** Every function in JavaScript has a `prototype` property.  This `prototype` property is an object.  When you create an object using the `new` keyword with that function (which acts as a constructor), the newly created object's `__proto__` (or its internal [[Prototype]]) is set to the function's `prototype` object.  The function's `prototype` object also has a `constructor` property that points back to the function itself.

**Example**

```javascript
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log(this.name + " makes a sound.");
};

function Dog(name, breed) {
  Animal.call(this, name); // Call the Animal constructor to set the name
  this.breed = breed;
}

// Set Dog's prototype to an instance of Animal. This is the key to inheritance.
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Important: Reset the constructor after setting the prototype.
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;  // Very important!

Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
  console.log("Woof!");
};

let myDog = new Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever");

myDog.speak(); // Output: Buddy makes a sound. (Inherited from Animal)
myDog.bark();  // Output: Woof! (Defined on Dog)

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(myDog) === Dog.prototype); // true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype) === Animal.prototype); // true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Animal.prototype) === Object.prototype); // true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype) === null); // true (End of the chain)

console.log(myDog instanceof Dog); // true
console.log(myDog instanceof Animal); // true (Because Dog inherits from Animal)
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

1. **`Animal` Constructor:**  Creates `Animal` objects with a `name` property.  `Animal.prototype.speak` defines a method shared by all `Animal` instances.

2. **`Dog` Constructor:** Creates `Dog` objects with a `name` and `breed`.  It uses `Animal.call(this, name)` to reuse the `Animal` constructor and set the `name` property.

3. **`Object.create(Animal.prototype)`:** This is the crucial step for inheritance. It creates a *new* object whose prototype is `Animal.prototype`.  We then set `Dog.prototype` to this new object. This means that `Dog` objects will inherit properties and methods from `Animal`.

4. **`Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;`:**  This is *extremely* important.  Because we replaced `Dog.prototype` with a new object, the `constructor` property of `Dog.prototype` no longer pointed to `Dog`. We manually reset it to `Dog` to maintain the correct constructor relationship.

5. **`Dog.prototype.bark`:** Defines a method specific to `Dog` objects.

6. **`new Dog(...)`:** Creates a new `Dog` instance.  Its prototype (`__proto__` or [[Prototype]]) is `Dog.prototype`.

7. **`myDog.speak()`:**  `myDog` doesn't have a `speak` method directly.  JavaScript looks up the prototype chain, finds `speak` on `Animal.prototype`, and executes it.

8. **`myDog instanceof Animal`:** Returns `true` because `myDog`'s prototype chain includes `Animal.prototype`.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Prototypes are the foundation of inheritance in JavaScript.
* The prototype chain allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
* `Object.create()` is the preferred way to create prototype-based inheritance.
* Resetting the `constructor` after setting the prototype is crucial.
* Understanding prototypes is essential for mastering JavaScript's object model.

Let me know if you'd like more examples or want to explore other related concepts like prototype pollution or class syntax (which is built on prototypes under the hood)!




Event-driven architecture in JavaScript is a paradigm where applications are structured around the production and consumption of events.  Instead of direct function calls between components, they interact by emitting and listening for events. This promotes loose coupling, making systems more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain.

Here's a breakdown of key concepts and how it's implemented in JavaScript:

**Core Concepts:**

* **Events:**  Represent something that has happened in the application.  Examples: a button click, data being received, a timer expiring, a file being uploaded.  Events are often represented as objects with properties describing the event.

* **Event Emitters (Publishers):** Objects that are responsible for generating or "emitting" events.  They don't necessarily know who will be listening for these events.

* **Event Listeners (Subscribers):** Objects that are interested in specific events.  They "subscribe" to those events and define what actions to take when the event occurs (event handlers).

* **Event Channels/Message Brokers (Optional but Recommended for Complex Systems):** In more complex architectures, an event channel or message broker acts as an intermediary.  Emitters publish events to the channel, and listeners subscribe to events through the channel.  This adds a layer of abstraction and improves scalability.

**Implementation in JavaScript:**

JavaScript provides several ways to implement event-driven architecture:

1. **Custom Event Emitters:**  You can create your own event emitter classes using plain JavaScript objects or classes. This is useful for simple scenarios.

```javascript
class EventEmitter {
  constructor() {
    this.listeners = {};
  }

  on(event, callback) {
    if (!this.listeners[event]) {
      this.listeners[event] = [];
    }
    this.listeners[event].push(callback);
  }

  emit(event, ...args) {
    if (this.listeners[event]) {
      this.listeners[event].forEach(listener => listener(...args));
    }
  }

  off(event, callback) { // To remove listeners
    if (this.listeners[event]) {
      this.listeners[event] = this.listeners[event].filter(l => l !== callback);
    }
  }
}

const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

myEmitter.on('dataReceived', (data) => {
  console.log('Data received:', data);
});

myEmitter.on('dataReceived', (data) => {
    console.log('Another handler for dataReceived', data);
});

myEmitter.emit('dataReceived', { name: 'Alice', age: 30 }); // Output: Data received: { name: 'Alice', age: 30 }

myEmitter.off('dataReceived', console.log); // Example of removing a listener

myEmitter.emit('dataReceived', {name: 'Bob'}); // Only the first listener will be called.
```

2. **DOM Events:**  The browser's Document Object Model (DOM) heavily uses events.  You can attach event listeners to HTML elements to respond to user interactions (clicks, mouseovers, form submissions, etc.).

```javascript
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log('Button clicked!');
});
```

3. **Node.js Events:** In Node.js, the `events` module provides an `EventEmitter` class.  This is a core building block for many Node.js modules.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');

const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

myEmitter.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log('Received data:', data);
});

myEmitter.emit('data', 'Some important information');
```

4. **Libraries and Frameworks:**  Many JavaScript libraries and frameworks (like React, Angular, Vue.js, and others) have their own event systems or mechanisms for handling events, often built on top of the core JavaScript event mechanisms.

**Benefits of Event-Driven Architecture:**

* **Loose Coupling:** Components are independent and don't need to know about each other directly.  This makes it easier to change or replace components without affecting others.

* **Scalability:**  Event-driven systems can be scaled more easily.  You can add more listeners or emitters without creating complex dependencies.

* **Flexibility:**  New features can be added by simply creating new event listeners without modifying existing code.

* **Maintainability:**  The modularity of event-driven architecture makes code easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

**Use Cases:**

* User interfaces (handling user interactions)
* Real-time applications (chat, notifications)
* Asynchronous operations (handling callbacks, promises)
* Microservices architecture (communication between services)
* Message queues and data streaming

**Considerations:**

* **Complexity:**  In very complex systems, event handling can become difficult to manage if not properly structured.  Event channels or message brokers can help.
* **Debugging:**  Tracing the flow of events can sometimes be challenging.  Good logging and debugging tools are important.

Event-driven architecture is a powerful paradigm that can greatly improve the design and maintainability of your JavaScript applications.  Choosing the right approach (custom event emitters, DOM events, Node.js events, or framework-specific mechanisms) depends on the complexity of your project.

# Designing RESTful APIs

**1. Understand REST Principles:**

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services.  Key principles include:

* **Client-Server:**  The client (frontend) and server (backend) are separate entities.
* **Stateless:**  Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information necessary to understand and process the request. The server doesn't store client state between requests.
* **Cacheable:** Responses can be cached to improve performance.
* **Layered System:**  The system can be composed of multiple layers (e.g., load balancers, proxies) without the client knowing.
* **Code-On-Demand (Optional):**  Server can send executable code to the client (e.g., JavaScript). Less common today.
* **Uniform Interface:**  This is the most important principle and encompasses several aspects:

    * **Resource Identification:** Resources are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
    * **Manipulation of Resources Through Representations:**  Resources are manipulated using representations (e.g., JSON, XML) exchanged between the client and server.
    * **Self-Descriptive Messages:**  Messages contain enough information to be understood by the receiver.
    * **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS):**  The server provides links in its responses that guide the client through the available actions.  This is the most advanced and often less implemented aspect of REST.

**2. Define Resources and Endpoints:**

Identify the core resources your API will expose.  Resources are the "nouns" of your API.  Examples: `users`, `products`, `orders`.

Design endpoints (URLs) that follow a consistent and intuitive structure:

* Use nouns for resource names (e.g., `/users`, `/products`).
* Use plural nouns for collections of resources.
* Use HTTP methods to represent actions on resources:

    * `GET`: Retrieve a resource or a list of resources.
    * `POST`: Create a new resource.
    * `PUT`: Update an existing resource.
    * `PATCH`: Partially update an existing resource.
    * `DELETE`: Delete a resource.

* Use path parameters to identify specific resources:  `/users/123` (user with ID 123).
* Use query parameters for filtering, sorting, and pagination: `/products?category=electronics&sort=price&page=2`.

**Example Endpoints:**

* `GET /users`: Get a list of users.
* `GET /users/123`: Get user with ID 123.
* `POST /users`: Create a new user.
* `PUT /users/123`: Update user with ID 123.
* `PATCH /users/123`: Partially update user with ID 123.
* `DELETE /users/123`: Delete user with ID 123.

**3. Choose a Data Format:**

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the most common and recommended format for REST APIs due to its simplicity and compatibility with JavaScript.

**4. Implement Proper Status Codes:**

Use HTTP status codes to communicate the outcome of a request to the client:

* `200 OK`: Success.
* `201 Created`: Resource created successfully.
* `204 No Content`: Request processed successfully, but no content to return.
* `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request.
* `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required.
* `403 Forbidden`: User doesn't have permission.
* `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
* `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error.

**5. Handle Errors Gracefully:**

Provide informative error messages in the response body when errors occur.  Don't expose sensitive information.

**6. Implement Pagination:**

For APIs that return large lists of resources, implement pagination to avoid overwhelming the client.  Use query parameters like `page` and `limit` to control the number of results returned.

**7. Versioning:**

Versioning allows you to make changes to your API without breaking existing clients.  Use URL versioning (e.g., `/v1/users`, `/v2/users`) or header versioning.

**8. Security:**

* **Authentication:** Verify the identity of the client (e.g., using API keys, OAuth).
* **Authorization:** Control what resources a client can access.
* **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server.
* **Input Validation:** Validate all user input to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

**9. Documentation:**

Create clear and comprehensive documentation for your API using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.  Good documentation is essential for developers who will use your API.

**10. Testing:**

Thoroughly test your API using tools like Postman or automated testing frameworks.  Test all endpoints, HTTP methods, and error handling.

**11. HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State):**

This is the most advanced and often less implemented aspect of REST.  It involves including links in the API responses that guide the client through the available actions.  This makes the API more discoverable and self-documenting.

**Example HATEOAS Response:**

```json
{
  "userId": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "self",
      "href": "/users/123"
    },
    {
      "rel": "orders",
      "href": "/users/123/orders"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Tools and Technologies:**

* **Frameworks:** Node.js (Express), Python (Flask, Django REST Framework), Ruby on Rails, etc.
* **Documentation:** Swagger, OpenAPI
* **Testing:** Postman, Mocha, Jest
* **API Gateways:** Kong, Apigee

By following these guidelines, you can design robust, scalable, and maintainable RESTful APIs that are easy to use and understand.  Remember that REST is a set of principles, and there is some flexibility in how you implement it.  The most important thing is to be consistent and to design your API in a way that makes sense for your application.


# API security

**1. Authentication:**

* **API Keys:** Simple but less secure.  Suitable for low-risk APIs.  Rotate keys regularly.
* **OAuth 2.0:** Industry standard for delegated authorization.  Allows third-party applications to access resources on behalf of a user without sharing their credentials.
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**  Compact and self-contained way to represent claims securely between parties.  Used for authentication and authorization.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Add an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of authentication (e.g., password + code from authenticator app).

**2. Authorization:**

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assign roles to users and grant permissions to those roles.
* **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** More fine-grained control based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users and applications.

**3. Input Validation:**

* **Sanitize User Input:**  Prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection) by validating and sanitizing all user input.  Never trust user input.
* **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that data is of the expected type (e.g., number, string, email).
* **Length Restrictions:** Limit the length of input fields to prevent buffer overflows.
* **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate input formats (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).
* **Whitelist Input:** Only allow specific characters or patterns in input fields.

**4. HTTPS:**

* **Always Use HTTPS:** Encrypt all communication between the client and server using HTTPS.  This protects data in transit.
* **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):**  Tell browsers to only access your API over HTTPS.

**5. Rate Limiting:**

* **Prevent Abuse:**  Limit the number of requests that a client can make within a given time frame.  This helps prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and abuse.
* **Implement Rate Limiting:** Use libraries or API gateways to implement rate limiting.

**6. Error Handling:**

* **Don't Expose Sensitive Information:** Avoid returning detailed error messages that could reveal information about your API's internals.
* **Generic Error Messages:** Return generic error messages to the client and log detailed errors on the server.

**7. Security Headers:**

* **Use Security Headers:** Implement security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection to mitigate various attacks.

**8. API Gateways:**

* **Centralized Security:** Use an API gateway to manage authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and other security concerns in a centralized way.
* **Protection Against Attacks:** API gateways can help protect against common attacks like DDoS and bot attacks.

**9. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

* **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in your API.
* **Fix Vulnerabilities:**  Address any vulnerabilities that are found promptly.

**10. Keep Software Updated:**

* **Patch Vulnerabilities:** Keep all software and libraries used by your API up to date with the latest security patches.

**11. Data Encryption at Rest:**

* **Protect Data:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest to protect it in case of a data breach.

**12. Logging and Monitoring:**

* **Track API Activity:** Log all API requests and responses to monitor for suspicious activity.
* **Set Up Alerts:** Set up alerts for unusual patterns or suspicious requests.

**13. Input Validation on the Server-Side:**

* **Essential Security:** Never rely solely on client-side input validation.  Always validate input on the server-side.

**14. Secure Coding Practices:**

* **Follow Best Practices:** Follow secure coding practices to avoid common vulnerabilities.
* **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to identify security issues.

**15. Dependency Management:**

* **Secure Dependencies:**  Use tools to manage and scan your API's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

**16. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):**

* **Control Access:** Configure CORS properly to restrict which origins can access your API.  Only allow trusted origins.

**17. Content Negotiation:**

* **Prevent Content Sniffing:**  Set the `X-Content-Type-Options` header to `nosniff` to prevent browsers from trying to guess the content type of responses.

**18. Denial-of-Service (DoS) Protection:**

* **Implement DoS Protection:** Use techniques like rate limiting, traffic shaping, and web application firewalls (WAFs) to protect your API from DoS attacks.

**19. Be Aware of OWASP API Security Top 10:**

* **Stay Informed:** Familiarize yourself with the OWASP API Security Top 10 list of common API security vulnerabilities.

**20. Zero Trust Security:**

* **Verify Every Request:** Implement a Zero Trust security model, where every request is verified, regardless of its origin.

By implementing these security measures, you can significantly improve the security of your API and protect it from a wide range of threats.  API security is an ongoing process, so it's important to stay informed about new vulnerabilities and best practices.




# Designing a multi-tenant API

**1. Tenant Identification:**

This is the most fundamental aspect.  You need a way to distinguish between requests from different tenants.  Common approaches include:

* **Header-Based:** Include a custom header (e.g., `X-Tenant-ID`) in each request.  This is a popular and relatively simple approach.

* **URL-Based (Subdomain or Path):**  Use subdomains (e.g., `tenant1.example.com`, `tenant2.example.com`) or URL paths (e.g., `example.com/tenant1`, `example.com/tenant2`) to identify tenants.  This can be more user-friendly but might require more complex routing configurations.

* **Query Parameter:** Include a tenant ID as a query parameter (e.g., `example.com/users?tenantId=123`).  This is generally less preferred due to potential security concerns (e.g., accidentally exposing tenant IDs in logs or URLs).

* **Authentication Context:**  If you're using authentication (which you should be!), you can store the tenant ID within the user's authentication context (e.g., in a JWT).  This is a secure and efficient approach.

**2. Data Isolation:**

Tenants' data must be completely isolated from each other.  Several strategies exist:

* **Separate Databases:** The most robust approach.  Each tenant has their own database.  This provides the highest level of isolation but can be more complex to manage.

* **Schema-Based:**  Tenants share the same database server but have separate schemas.  This offers good isolation and is easier to manage than separate databases.

* **Table-Based (Discriminator Column):**  Tenants share the same database and schema, but each table has a "tenant ID" column.  This is the least isolated approach and can lead to performance issues if not implemented carefully.  It's generally less recommended for sensitive data.

**3. API Design:**

* **Consistent Endpoints:**  Design your API endpoints to be consistent across all tenants.  The tenant ID should be handled transparently by the API and not exposed as part of the endpoint URL (unless you're using URL-based tenant identification).

* **Tenant-Specific Configuration:**  Allow tenants to customize certain aspects of the API behavior (e.g., branding, email templates, features).  Store these configurations per tenant.

* **Versioning:**  Implement API versioning to allow you to make changes to the API without breaking existing tenants.

**4. Authentication and Authorization:**

* **Tenant-Aware Authentication:** Ensure that authentication mechanisms are aware of the tenant context.  For example, when a user logs in, their tenant ID should be associated with their session or token.

* **Tenant-Specific Authorization:** Implement authorization rules that enforce data isolation.  Users should only be able to access data belonging to their tenant.

**5. Rate Limiting:**

* **Tenant-Specific Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on a per-tenant basis to prevent one tenant from consuming all the resources.

**6. Data Backup and Restore:**

* **Tenant-Specific Backups:** Implement backup and restore procedures that can be performed on a per-tenant basis.

**7. Monitoring and Logging:**

* **Tenant-Specific Monitoring:** Monitor API usage and performance on a per-tenant basis.
* **Tenant-Specific Logging:**  Log API requests and responses with the tenant ID to facilitate debugging and auditing.

**8. Deployment and Infrastructure:**

* **Scalability:** Design your infrastructure to be scalable to accommodate a growing number of tenants.
* **Resource Allocation:** Consider how you will allocate resources (e.g., CPU, memory) to each tenant.

**9. Tenant Management:**

* **Provisioning:**  Provide a way for new tenants to be provisioned.
* **Management Portal:**  Create a portal for tenants to manage their accounts and configurations.

**Example (Header-Based, Schema-Based):**

1. Client sends a request with the `X-Tenant-ID` header (e.g., `X-Tenant-ID: 123`).

2. The API gateway or middleware intercepts the request and extracts the tenant ID.

3. The API uses the tenant ID to determine the appropriate database schema to use.

4. The API queries the database using the correct schema, ensuring data isolation.

5. The API returns the response to the client.

**Choosing the Right Strategy:**

The best multi-tenancy strategy depends on your specific requirements, including:

* **Data sensitivity:**  Separate databases offer the highest level of isolation for highly sensitive data.
* **Scalability:**  Schema-based or table-based approaches can be more scalable for a large number of tenants.
* **Cost:**  Separate databases can be more expensive to manage.
* **Complexity:**  Table-based approaches are the simplest to implement but offer the least isolation.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Performance:**  Optimize database queries and indexing for multi-tenancy.
* **Security:**  Thoroughly test your API to ensure data isolation and prevent security vulnerabilities.
* **Maintainability:**  Design your API to be easy to maintain and upgrade as your tenant base grows.

By carefully considering these factors and choosing the appropriate multi-tenancy strategy, you can design a robust and scalable API that meets the needs of your SaaS application.


Authentication and authorization are two distinct but closely related processes in computer security. They are often used together to control access to resources and protect sensitive data. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

**Authentication**

* **Definition:** Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device. It answers the question "Who are you?"
* **Methods:** Authentication typically involves providing credentials, such as:
    * Passwords
    * Usernames
    * Biometrics (fingerprints, facial recognition)
    * Security tokens
    * Digital certificates
* **Purpose:** The primary goal of authentication is to ensure that only legitimate users or devices can access a system or resource.

**Authorization**

* **Definition:** Authorization is the process of determining what a user or device is allowed to do after they have been authenticated. It answers the question "What are you allowed to do?"
* **Methods:** Authorization is often based on:
    * Roles (e.g., administrator, user, guest)
    * Permissions (e.g., read, write, execute)
    * Attributes (e.g., user's department, resource sensitivity)
* **Purpose:** The main purpose of authorization is to enforce access control policies and restrict users or devices to only the resources and actions they are permitted to access.

**Key Differences Summarized**

| Feature | Authentication | Authorization |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Verify identity | Determine access rights |
| **Question** | Who are you? | What are you allowed to do? |
| **Timing** | Typically occurs before authorization | Occurs after successful authentication |
| **Examples** | Entering a username and password | Being granted access to specific files or folders |

**Analogy**

Think of it like a nightclub:

* **Authentication:** Checking your ID at the door to make sure you are who you claim to be.
* **Authorization:** The bouncer determining whether you are allowed into the VIP area based on your status or ticket.

**Relationship**

Authentication and authorization work together to secure systems and data. Authentication establishes who a user is, and authorization determines what they can do once their identity is confirmed.

**Importance**

Both authentication and authorization are crucial for security:

* **Authentication:** Prevents unauthorized individuals from accessing a system.
* **Authorization:** Limits the damage that can be done by a compromised account or malicious user.

**In Summary**

Authentication and authorization are fundamental security concepts. Understanding the difference between them is essential for designing and implementing secure systems and applications.
