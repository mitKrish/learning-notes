# **var**
- The var statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- Global variables are 
	- declared outside of a function
	- declared with a window object.
	- declared as a variable without using var(will not work if "use strict" used).	
- Functional variables are
	- declared inside a function.
	- Accessed within the function.
- var allows variables to be hoisted
- var allows re-declaring a variable.

# **let and const**
- let and const are block scoped.
- let and const will not hoist variables and throws an error.
- let and const do not allow re-declaring a variable
**let & const diff**
let - values can be changed.
const - values cannot be changed.(object properties can be updated).
