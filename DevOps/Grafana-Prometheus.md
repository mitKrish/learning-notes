Prometheus and Grafana are a powerful open-source duo commonly used for monitoring and observability. Here's a breakdown of their roles and how they work together:

**Prometheus:**

* **Time-Series Database:**
    * Prometheus excels at collecting and storing time-series data, which are metrics recorded over time. This makes it ideal for monitoring system performance, application behavior, and other time-sensitive data.
* **Data Collection:**
    * It "scrapes" metrics from target systems (like servers, applications, or databases) at regular intervals. These targets expose metrics in a specific format that Prometheus understands.
* **PromQL:**
    * Prometheus uses a powerful query language called PromQL to analyze and manipulate the collected metrics. This allows you to create complex queries and derive meaningful insights from your data.
* **Alerting:**
    * Prometheus has a built-in alerting system that can trigger notifications when certain conditions are met (e.g., high CPU usage, low disk space).

**Grafana:**

* **Visualization:**
    * Grafana provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing time-series data. It can connect to various data sources, including Prometheus, and create interactive dashboards with graphs, charts, and tables.
* **Dashboards:**
    * Grafana dashboards allow you to organize and display your metrics in a way that makes it easy to understand the health and performance of your systems.
* **Alerting (Enhanced):**
    * While Prometheus has its own alerting, Grafana can also be configured to provide alerting, and can provide enhanced alerting capabilities.
* **Extensibility:**
    * Grafana has a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality, allowing you to visualize data from various sources and customize your dashboards.

**How They Work Together:**

1.  **Prometheus Collects Data:**
    * Prometheus scrapes metrics from your target systems and stores them in its time-series database.
2.  **Grafana Visualizes Data:**
    * Grafana connects to Prometheus as a data source.
    * You create dashboards in Grafana that use PromQL queries to retrieve and display metrics from Prometheus.
3.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * You can use Grafana dashboards to monitor your systems in real-time.
    * Both Prometheus and Grafana can trigger alerts based on defined thresholds.

**In essence:**

* Prometheus is the data collector and storage engine.
* Grafana is the visualization and dashboarding tool.

This combination makes them a very effective solution for monitoring and observability.
