**Core React Concepts:**

1.  **JSX Understanding:** Be able to explain what JSX is (syntactic sugar for `React.createElement`), its benefits (readability, similarity to HTML), and how it gets transformed into JavaScript. Understand its rules (single root element, self-closing tags, using `className` and `htmlFor`).
2.  **Component Types (Functional vs. Class):** Clearly articulate the differences between functional and class components, including their syntax, state management (using `useState` and `this.state`/`setState`), lifecycle methods (for class components and their functional equivalents using `useEffect`), and when to use each (functional components are often preferred for simplicity and performance).
3.  **Props and State:** Have a solid grasp of how data flows in React: props are read-only data passed down from parent to child components, while state is mutable data local to a component. Understand how to update state correctly using `setState` (in class components) and the state updater function (in `useState`).
4.  **Event Handling:** Explain how events are handled in React (synthetic events, camelCase naming, passing event handlers as props). Understand the concept of event delegation and its benefits.
5.  **Conditional Rendering:** Be comfortable with different ways to conditionally render elements in React (if/else, ternary operator, logical AND operator).

**State Management:**

6.  **Understanding State Management Needs:** Be able to discuss why state management becomes important in larger applications and the challenges it addresses (prop drilling, managing global data).
7.  **Common State Management Libraries (Redux, Context API, Zustand, Recoil):** Have a basic understanding of at least one or two popular state management solutions. For Redux, know the core concepts (actions, reducers, store, dispatch). For Context API, understand its use cases for simpler global state. Be aware of newer alternatives like Zustand and Recoil and their key features.
8.  **Choosing the Right State Management:** Be prepared to discuss factors that influence the choice of a state management solution (application size, complexity, team familiarity).

**Hooks:**

9.  **Deep Understanding of `useEffect`:** Go beyond the basic examples. Understand its dependency array and how it controls when the effect runs. Explain the cleanup function and its importance for preventing memory leaks. Be able to discuss common `useEffect` use cases (data fetching, subscriptions, timers, manual DOM manipulation).
10. **Other Built-in Hooks:** Be familiar with other essential hooks like `useState`, `useContext`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `useReducer`. Understand their purpose and when to use them to manage state, context, references, memoization, and complex state logic.
11. **Custom Hooks:** Understand the concept of creating custom hooks to extract and reuse component logic, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code. Be able to provide simple examples.

**Performance Optimization:**

12. **Understanding Performance Bottlenecks:** Be aware of common performance issues in React applications (unnecessary re-renders).
13. **Optimization Techniques:** Be able to discuss various optimization strategies, including:
    * `shouldComponentUpdate` (for class components) and `React.memo` (for functional components) for preventing unnecessary re-renders.
    * Using keys efficiently when rendering lists.
    * Lazy loading components with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
    * Code splitting to reduce initial bundle size.
    * Memoizing expensive computations with `useMemo` and `useCallback`.

**Routing:**

14. **Client-Side Routing:** Understand the concept of client-side routing in single-page applications and its benefits.
15. **Common Routing Libraries (React Router):** Be familiar with a popular routing library like React Router and its core components (`BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Switch`, `Link`, `useParams`, `useHistory`).

**Testing:**

16. **Types of Testing:** Understand the different types of testing relevant to React applications (unit, integration, end-to-end).
17. **Testing Libraries (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress):** Have some familiarity with common testing libraries and their strengths. Be able to discuss how you would test different aspects of a React component (rendering, props, state, user interactions).

**Styling:**

18. **CSS-in-JS vs. Traditional CSS:** Be aware of different styling approaches in React and their trade-offs (styled-components, Emotion, CSS Modules, plain CSS).

**General Concepts:**

19. **Virtual DOM vs. Real DOM:** Explain the concept of the Virtual DOM and how React uses it to efficiently update the UI.
20. **React Lifecycle (for Class Components):** Understand the different lifecycle methods and their purpose (mounting, updating, unmounting phases).
21. **Error Handling:** Be familiar with error boundaries (`componentDidCatch` in class components, `useErrorBoundary` in libraries) for gracefully handling errors in component trees.
22. **Asynchronous Operations:** Understand how to handle asynchronous operations (like API calls) in React using `useEffect` and `async/await` or Promises.
23. **Accessibility (A11y):** Be aware of the importance of making React applications accessible and some basic principles (semantic HTML, ARIA attributes).

**Behavioral/Problem-Solving Aspects:**

24. **Debugging Skills:** Be prepared to discuss your approach to debugging React applications.
25. **Problem-Solving:** Be ready for coding challenges or questions that require you to think through a problem and propose a React-based solution.
26. **Staying Up-to-Date:** Mention how you keep up with the latest trends and updates in the React ecosystem.
