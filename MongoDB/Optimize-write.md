**1. Bulk Operations:**

* **Concept:** Instead of sending 1 million individual write requests, group them into larger batches. This significantly reduces network overhead and improves efficiency.
* **Code Example (Node.js):**

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function bulkWriteExample() {
  const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
  const client = new MongoClient(uri);

  try {
    await client.connect();
    const database = client.db('mydatabase');
    const collection = database.collection('mycollection');

    const operations = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
      operations.push({
        insertOne: { document: { _id: i, value: `data_${i}` } },
      });
      if (operations.length >= 1000) {
        await collection.bulkWrite(operations);
        operations.length = 0; // Clear the array
      }
    }
    if(operations.length>0){
      await collection.bulkWrite(operations);
    }

    console.log('Bulk write completed');
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}

bulkWriteExample().catch(console.dir);

```

* **Explanation:**
    * The code groups `insertOne` operations into batches of 1000.
    * `collection.bulkWrite()` sends the entire batch to the server in a single request.
    * The remaining operations are sent at the end, in case the total operations are not evenly divisible by the batch size.

**2. Ordered vs. Unordered Bulk Operations:**

* **Ordered:** Operations are executed in the order they appear in the array. If one operation fails, subsequent operations are not executed.
* **Unordered:** Operations are executed in parallel, and failures do not stop other operations. This is generally faster but does not guarantee order.
* **Choosing:** Use `unordered` when order doesn't matter and performance is critical. Use `ordered` when you need to maintain the sequence of operations.
* **Code Example (Unordered):**
    ```javascript
    await collection.bulkWrite(operations, { ordered: false });
    ```

**3. Indexing:**

* **Concept:** Indexes significantly speed up write operations, especially when inserting or updating documents with specific fields.
* **Best Practices:**
    * Create indexes on fields that are frequently used in queries or updates.
    * Avoid over-indexing, as each index consumes storage and adds overhead to write operations.
    * Consider compound indexes for queries that involve multiple fields.
* **Code Example (Creating an Index):**
    ```javascript
    await collection.createIndex({ value: 1 });
    ```

**4. Write Concern:**

* **Concept:** Write concern determines the level of acknowledgment from the MongoDB server for write operations.
* **Options:**
    * `w: 1`: Acknowledgment from a single node.
    * `w: "majority"`: Acknowledgment from a majority of nodes in a replica set.
    * `j: true`: Acknowledgment that the write operation has been written to the journal.
    * `wtimeout`: maximum time to wait for write concern fulfillment.
* **Choosing:** Select the appropriate write concern based on your application's data consistency and durability requirements. For large bulk writes, reducing the level of write concern can improve performance, but at the risk of data loss.
* **Code Example:**
    ```javascript
    await collection.bulkWrite(operations, { writeConcern: { w: 1 } });
    ```

**5. Connection Pooling:**

* **Concept:** Reusing database connections reduces the overhead of establishing new connections for each write operation.
* **Best Practices:**
    * Use a MongoDB driver that supports connection pooling.
    * Configure the connection pool size appropriately for your application's workload.
* **MongoDB Drivers:** Most modern drivers handle connection pooling automatically.

**6. Sharding (If Applicable):**

* **Concept:** Sharding distributes data across multiple servers (shards), allowing for horizontal scaling and improved write throughput.
* **When to Use:** If you have a very large dataset or high write volume that exceeds the capacity of a single server.
* **Complexity:** Sharding adds complexity to your MongoDB deployment and requires careful planning and configuration.

**7. Avoiding Common Pitfalls:**

* **Individual Inserts:** Avoid inserting documents one at a time. This is extremely inefficient.
* **Excessive Logging:** Disable or reduce logging during bulk write operations to minimize overhead.
* **Large Documents:** Avoid inserting very large documents, as they can slow down write operations.
* **Unnecessary Indexes:** Too many indexes will slow down write operations. Only create indexes that are truly needed.
* **Insufficient Resources:** Ensure that your MongoDB server has sufficient CPU, memory, and disk I/O to handle the write load.
* **Ignoring Network Latency:** Network latency can significantly impact write performance. Place your application and MongoDB server in close proximity.
* **Not monitoring performance:** Monitor the mongod logs, and use tools like mongotop, mongostat, and MongoDB Atlas performance advisor to see how your database is performing during the data load.
* **Not having enough RAM:** If the working set of your data cannot fit into RAM, disk I/O will become a bottleneck.

**8. Batch Size:**

* The optimal batch size for bulk operations depends on your hardware, network, and data. Experiment with different batch sizes to find the best performance. A good starting point is 1000.
* Very large batch sizes can cause network issues or exceed the maximum BSON document size.

**9. Performance Considerations:**

* **Hardware:**
    * Use SSDs for fast I/O.
    * Ensure sufficient RAM to accommodate the working set.
    * Use a powerful CPU to handle the update load.
* **Connection Pooling:**
    * Use connection pooling in your application to minimize connection overhead.
* **Write Concern:**
    * Adjust the write concern based on your data durability requirements.
    * For performance, consider using a lower write concern, but be aware of the potential for data loss.
* **MongoDB Atlas:**
    * If using MongoDB Atlas, leverage its performance monitoring and scaling capabilities.
* **Monitoring:**
    * Monitor MongoDB performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, query performance).
    * Use the MongoDB profiler to identify slow queries.
* **Sharding (if needed):**
    * If the volume of data continues to grow, consider sharding the attendance collection. Shard on `{ workerId: 1, date: 1 }` or `{date: 1}`.
* **Replication:**
    * Ensure a replica set is in place for redundancy and read scaling.
* **Minimize Network Latency:** ensure that the application server, and the mongodb server are in the same or close data centers.
* **Scheduled Updates:** Schedule the update process during off-peak hours to minimize impact on other operations.

**10. Error Handling and Retry Logic:**

* **Implement error handling:** Capture and log any errors that occur during the update process.
* **Retry logic:** Implement retry logic for transient errors, such as network connectivity issues.
* **Idempotency:** ensure that the update operations are idempotent.

**11. Data Validation:**

* **Validate input data:** Ensure that the input data is valid before updating the database.
* **Use schema validation:** Use MongoDB schema validation to enforce data integrity.

**Example workflow:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Gather attendance data from your source (e.g., time clocks, mobile app).
2.  **Data Transformation:** Transform the data into the format required by the MongoDB schema.
3.  **Batch Processing:** Divide the data into batches.
4.  **Bulk Updates:** Use `bulkWrite()` to update the attendance collection.
5.  **Error Handling:** Log and handle any errors.
6.  **Monitoring:** Monitor database performance.
