Event bubbling and capturing are two phases in the event propagation process in the DOM (Document Object Model). They determine the order in which event listeners are executed when an event occurs on an element.

**Event Bubbling:**

* **Description:**  The event "bubbles up" from the target element (the element where the event originated) to its parent elements, and then to its parent's parent, and so on, up the DOM tree until it reaches the document object.
* **Execution Order:** Event handlers attached to the target element are executed first, followed by event handlers attached to its parent, then its grandparent, and so on.
* **Default Behavior:** Event bubbling is the default behavior in most browsers.

**Example (Bubbling):**

```html
<div id="parent">
  <button id="child">Click me</button>
</div>

<script>
  const parent = document.getElementById('parent');
  const child = document.getElementById('child');

  child.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Child clicked (bubbling)');
  });

  parent.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Parent clicked (bubbling)');
  });
</script>
```

In this example, when the button is clicked, the "Child clicked" message will be logged first, followed by the "Parent clicked" message.  The event bubbles up from the button to the div.

**Event Capturing:**

* **Description:** The event travels *down* the DOM tree from the document object to the target element.
* **Execution Order:** Event handlers attached to the ancestors of the target element are executed first, followed by event handlers attached to the target element itself.
* **Use Capture Phase:** To use the capturing phase, you need to set the `useCapture` option to `true` when adding the event listener.

**Example (Capturing):**

```html
<div id="parent">
  <button id="child">Click me</button>
</div>

<script>
  const parent = document.getElementById('parent');
  const child = document.getElementById('child');

  parent.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Parent clicked (capturing)');
  }, true); // Note: true for capture phase

  child.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Child clicked (capturing)');
  }, true); // Note: true for capture phase
</script>
```

In this example, when the button is clicked, the "Parent clicked" message will be logged first, followed by the "Child clicked" message. The event is captured as it travels down to the target.

**Event Propagation Flow (Bubbling and Capturing Combined):**

1. **Capturing Phase:** The event travels down the DOM tree, and event listeners registered for the capturing phase on the ancestors of the target element are executed.
2. **Target Phase:** The event reaches the target element, and event listeners attached to the target element (in the order they were added) are executed.
3. **Bubbling Phase:** The event bubbles up the DOM tree, and event listeners registered for the bubbling phase on the ancestors of the target element are executed.

**`stopPropagation()`:**

You can use the `event.stopPropagation()` method to stop the event from propagating further up or down the DOM tree.  This can be useful in certain situations, but it can also make your code harder to reason about if overused.

**Example (`stopPropagation()`):**

```javascript
child.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  console.log('Child clicked');
  event.stopPropagation(); // Stop event propagation
});

parent.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log('Parent clicked'); // This will not be executed
});
```

In this example, clicking the button will only log "Child clicked".  The `event.stopPropagation()` method prevents the event from bubbling up to the parent element.

**Use Cases:**

* **Capturing:** Capturing is less commonly used than bubbling.  It can be useful when you want to handle an event at a higher level in the DOM before it reaches the target element.  For example, you might use capturing to implement event delegation.
* **Bubbling:** Bubbling is the default and often the most convenient behavior.  It's commonly used for handling events on elements within a container.

**Which to Use?**

In most cases, event bubbling is sufficient and easier to work with.  Capturing should be used sparingly and only when necessary.  Understanding both phases is crucial for mastering event handling in JavaScript.
