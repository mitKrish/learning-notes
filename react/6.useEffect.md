`useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you perform side effects in functional components.  Side effects are actions that interact with the outside world (or things outside the component's direct rendering logic), such as:

* **Data fetching:** Making API calls to retrieve data.
* **Subscriptions:** Setting up event listeners or subscribing to data streams.
* **DOM manipulations:** Directly changing the DOM (although often avoided in React).
* **Timers:** Setting up `setTimeout` or `setInterval`.
* **Logging:**  (Less common but sometimes useful)

`useEffect` is conceptually similar to `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` combined from class components, but it's more flexible and easier to use in functional components.

**Basic Usage:**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Component mounted or updated'); // Side effect

    document.title = `Count: ${count}`; // Example: Updating the document title

    // Cleanup function (optional):
    return () => {
      console.log('Component unmounted or about to update'); // Cleanup side effect
    };
  }, [count]); // Dependency array

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`useEffect(callback, dependencyArray)`:** The `useEffect` hook takes two arguments:
   - `callback`: The function containing the side effect logic.
   - `dependencyArray`: An array of values that the effect depends on.

2. **Callback Execution:**
   - **On Mount:** The callback function is executed *after* the initial render.
   - **On Update:** The callback function is executed *after* every subsequent render, *only if* any of the values in the `dependencyArray` have changed.
   - **On Unmount:** If a cleanup function is returned from the callback, that function is executed *before* the component is unmounted.

3. **Dependency Array:**
   - **Empty Array (`[]`):** The effect runs only once after the initial render (like `componentDidMount`).
   - **Array with Values (`[count]`):** The effect runs after the initial render and after every subsequent render *only if* the value of `count` has changed.
   - **No Array:** The effect runs after every render (like `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` combined).  Often avoided because it can lead to performance issues.

4. **Cleanup Function:**
   - The cleanup function (returned from the `useEffect` callback) is used to clean up any resources created by the side effect. This is important to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior. Examples:
     - Removing event listeners.
     - Clearing timers.
     - Canceling subscriptions.

**Common Use Cases and Examples:**

* **Fetching Data:**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setData(data));
}, []); // Empty array: Fetch only once on mount
```

* **Setting up a Subscription:**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someObservable.subscribe(data => {
    // ...
  });

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // Cleanup: Unsubscribe on unmount
  };
}, []);
```

* **Adding an Event Listener:**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize); // Cleanup
  };
}, []);
```

* **Updating the Document Title:** (As shown in the basic example)

**Key Points:**

* `useEffect` is the primary way to manage side effects in functional components.
* The dependency array controls when the effect runs.
* The cleanup function is crucial for preventing memory leaks and ensuring correct behavior.
* Multiple `useEffect` hooks can be used in a single component to separate different side effects.  This is generally a good practice for organization.

**Example with multiple useEffects:**

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => { // Count effect
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]);

  useEffect(() => { // Name effect
    console.log("Name changed:", name);
  }, [name]);

  // ... rest of component
}
```

By understanding how `useEffect` works, you can effectively manage side effects in your functional React components and build more robust and maintainable applications.  The key is to think about what dependencies your side effect has and use the dependency array appropriately.  Always remember to clean up!
