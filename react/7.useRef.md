`useRef` is a React Hook that returns a mutable ref object.  This ref object has a `.current` property that is initially `null`. You can use `useRef` for several purposes, primarily:

1. **Accessing DOM elements directly:**  This is the most common use case.  `useRef` allows you to get a direct reference to a DOM element, which can be useful for things like:
    * Focusing an input element.
    * Measuring the size or position of an element.
    * Triggering animations or other DOM manipulations.

2. **Storing mutable values that don't trigger re-renders:**  Unlike state, changing the `.current` property of a ref *does not* cause the component to re-render.  This makes it useful for storing values that you want to persist across renders but don't want to affect the UI.  Examples:
    * Storing a timer ID.
    * Storing a previous value of a prop or state.
    * Storing a mutable object that you're working with directly (less common but sometimes needed).

**Example 1: Accessing a DOM Element (Focusing an Input):**

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Focus the input on mount:
    inputRef.current.focus();

        // Example of accessing other properties:
        console.log("Input offsetHeight:", inputRef.current.offsetHeight);

  }, []); // Empty dependency array: Run only on mount

    const handleClick = () => {
        // Example of focusing on a button click:
        inputRef.current.focus();
    }


  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

**Explanation:**

* `useRef(null)` creates a ref object.  Initially, `inputRef.current` is `null`.
* The `ref` prop is set on the `<input>` element.  React will automatically assign the DOM element to `inputRef.current` when the component mounts.
* The `useEffect` hook (with an empty dependency array) runs after the component mounts. Inside the effect, we can access the DOM element using `inputRef.current` and call the `focus()` method.

**Example 2: Storing a Mutable Value (Timer ID):**

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const timerIdRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    timerIdRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Timeout executed!');
    }, 3000);

    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timerIdRef.current); // Clear the timeout on unmount or update
    };
  }, []); // Empty dependency array: Set up the timer only once

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

**Explanation:**

* `useRef(null)` creates a ref object to store the timer ID.
* The `useEffect` hook sets up the timeout. The timer ID is stored in `timerIdRef.current`.
* The cleanup function clears the timeout when the component unmounts.  This is crucial to prevent memory leaks.

**Key Differences Between `useRef` and `useState`:**

| Feature | `useRef` | `useState` |
|---|---|---|
| Re-renders | Changing `.current` does *not* trigger a re-render | Changing state *does* trigger a re-render |
| Use Cases | Accessing DOM elements, storing mutable values that don't affect the UI | Managing data that affects the UI |
| Initial Value | Can be any value (including `null`) | Can be any value |

**When to Use `useRef`:**

* When you need direct access to a DOM element.
* When you need to store a mutable value that doesn't need to cause a re-render.
* When you need to persist a value across renders without affecting the UI (e.g., previous prop value).

**When *Not* to Use `useRef`:**

* For managing data that should be reflected in the UI.  Use `useState` for that.
* For complex state logic.  `useState` or `useReducer` are better choices.

`useRef` is a powerful hook that provides a way to interact with the DOM and manage mutable values in functional components.  Understanding its different use cases is essential for effective React development.
