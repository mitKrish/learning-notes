React's component lifecycle (for class components) and hooks (for functional components) are mechanisms that allow you to "hook into" different stages of a component's life, from its creation (mounting) to its destruction (unmounting), and to updates in between.  They give you control over what happens at each of these stages.

**Class Component Lifecycle Methods:**

These are methods defined within a class component that React automatically calls at specific points in the component's life.

* **Mounting (Component Creation):**

    * **`constructor(props)`:** Called *before* the component is mounted.  Used to initialize state, bind event handlers, and set up refs.  You *must* call `super(props)` if you override the constructor.

    * **`static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`:** Called *before* rendering on both the initial mount and subsequent updates.  It should return an object to update the state, or `null` to indicate no state update.  Use this for derived state (state that depends on props).

    * **`render()`:**  Describes the UI.  It *must* be a pure function (no side effects).  It returns the JSX that represents the component's output.

    * **`componentDidMount()`:** Called *after* the component is mounted (inserted into the DOM).  This is a good place to perform side effects like fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or directly manipulating the DOM.

* **Updating (Component Re-renders):**

    * **`static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`:** (As described above)

    * **`shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`:** Called *before* re-rendering.  Allows you to optimize performance by returning `false` if the component doesn't need to update.  If you return `false`, `render()` and `componentDidUpdate()` will not be called.  `React.memo` and `useMemo` are often better options for functional components.

    * **`render()`:** (As described above)

    * **`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`:** Called *immediately before* the DOM is updated.  It can return a snapshot value, which will be passed as a third argument to `componentDidUpdate()`.  Useful for capturing information about the DOM before it changes (e.g., scroll position).

    * **`componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`:** Called *immediately after* an update occurs.  This is a good place to perform side effects based on the previous and current props/state (e.g., fetching data based on a changed prop).

* **Unmounting (Component Removal):**

    * **`componentWillUnmount()`:** Called *immediately before* a component is removed from the DOM.  Use this to clean up resources like timers, subscriptions, or event listeners to prevent memory leaks.

* **Error Handling:**

    * **`static getDerivedStateFromError(error)`:** Called *after* an error occurs during rendering, in a descendant component.  Use it to display a fallback UI instead of crashing.

    * **`componentDidCatch(error, info)`:** Called *after* an error occurs during rendering, in a descendant component.  Use it to log error information.

**Functional Component Hooks:**

Functional components don't have lifecycle methods in the same way as class components. Instead, they use *hooks* to manage state, side effects, and other lifecycle-related logic.

* **`useState()`:**  Manages state within a functional component.

* **`useEffect()`:**  Performs side effects (like data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulations) in functional components.  It's a combination of `componentDidMount()`, `componentDidUpdate()`, and `componentWillUnmount()`. The dependencies array determines when the effect runs.

* **`useContext()`:**  Accesses the context API.

* **`useReducer()`:**  Manages complex state logic.  An alternative to `useState()` when state updates are more involved.

* **`useCallback()`:**  Memoizes callback functions.

* **`useMemo()`:**  Memoizes computed values.

* **`useRef()`:**  Creates a mutable ref object that can be used to access DOM elements or store any mutable value.

* **`useLayoutEffect()`:**  Similar to `useEffect()`, but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations.  Use it when you need to make DOM changes that the browser needs to paint.

* **`useDebugValue()`:**  Used for debugging custom hooks.

**Example (useEffect):**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Component mounted or updated'); // Side effect
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`; // DOM manipulation

    return () => {
      console.log('Component unmounted or about to update'); // Cleanup
    };
  }, [count]); // Dependency array: Effect runs when count changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Key Differences Summarized:**

| Feature | Class Components | Functional Components |
|---|---|---|
| Lifecycle Management | Lifecycle methods | Hooks |
| State Management | `this.state` | `useState()` |
| Side Effects | `componentDidMount()`, `componentDidUpdate()`, `componentWillUnmount()` | `useEffect()` |

Understanding the component lifecycle and hooks is essential for building robust and performant React applications.  Choose the appropriate method or hook for the task at hand and always remember to clean up resources to prevent memory leaks.  For most new development, hooks (in functional components) are the modern and preferred approach.
