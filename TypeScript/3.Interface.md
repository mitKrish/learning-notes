## **Interfaces:**

* **Definition:**
    * Interfaces define the structure of an object, specifying the names and types of its properties and methods.
* **Purpose:**
    * They enforce type checking and ensure that objects conform to a specific contract.
    * They enhance code readability and maintainability by providing clear type definitions.

**Extending Interfaces:**

* **Syntax:**
    * You can extend an interface using the `extends` keyword.
    * This creates a new interface that inherits the properties and methods of the existing interface.
* **Example:**

```typescript
interface Animal {
  name: string;
  eat(): void;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
  bark(): void;
}

let myDog: Dog = {
  name: "Buddy",
  breed: "Golden Retriever",
  eat() {
    console.log("Dog is eating");
  },
  bark() {
    console.log("Woof!");
  },
};

myDog.eat();
myDog.bark();
console.log(myDog.breed);
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Animal` Interface:**
    * Defines the basic properties and methods that all animals should have.
2.  **`Dog` Interface:**
    * Extends the `Animal` interface using `extends`.
    * Inherits the `name` and `eat()` properties from `Animal`.
    * Adds its own specific properties and methods: `breed` and `bark()`.
3.  **`myDog` Object:**
    * Implements the `Dog` interface, ensuring it has all the required properties and methods.

**Multiple Interface Extension:**

* TypeScript also supports extending multiple interfaces.

```typescript
interface Colorful {
  color: string;
}

interface Printable {
  print(): void;
}

interface ColorfulPrintable extends Colorful, Printable {
  // additional properties or methods.
}

let myObject: ColorfulPrintable = {
  color: "red",
  print() {
    console.log("Printing in red");
  },
};
```

**Benefits of Extending Interfaces:**

* **Code Reusability:**
    * Avoids duplicating code by inheriting common properties and methods.
* **Hierarchical Type Definitions:**
    * Allows you to create a hierarchy of related types, making your code more organized.
* **Improved Maintainability:**
    * Changes to a base interface automatically propagate to its derived interfaces.
* **Enhanced Type Safety:**
    * Ensures that objects conform to the required contracts, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
