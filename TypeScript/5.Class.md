## Access Modifier

In TypeScript classes, `public`, `private`, and `protected` are access modifiers that control the visibility and accessibility of class members (properties and methods). Here's a breakdown of each:

**1. `public`**

* **Meaning:** Members declared as `public` are accessible from anywhere: within the class itself, from instances of the class, and from derived (child) classes.
* **Default:** If no access modifier is specified, members are `public` by default.
* **Example:**

    ```typescript
    class Animal {
      public name: string;

      constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
      }

      public makeSound(): void {
        console.log("Some generic sound");
      }
    }

    const myAnimal = new Animal("Generic Animal");
    console.log(myAnimal.name); // Accessible from outside
    myAnimal.makeSound();      // Accessible from outside
    ```

**2. `private`**

* **Meaning:** Members declared as `private` are only accessible within the class where they are defined. They cannot be accessed from outside the class or from derived classes.
* **Encapsulation:** `private` members help enforce encapsulation, hiding internal implementation details and preventing unintended modifications.
* **Example:**

    ```typescript
    class BankAccount {
      private balance: number = 0;

      public deposit(amount: number): void {
        if (amount > 0) {
          this.balance += amount;
        }
      }

      public getBalance(): number {
        return this.balance;
      }

      // trying to access balance outside of the class will result in a compile error.
    }

    const myAccount = new BankAccount();
    myAccount.deposit(100);
    console.log(myAccount.getBalance()); // Output: 100
    // console.log(myAccount.balance); // Error: Property 'balance' is private and only accessible within class 'BankAccount'.
    ```

**3. `protected`**

* **Meaning:** Members declared as `protected` are accessible within the class where they are defined and in derived (child) classes. They are not accessible from outside the class hierarchy.
* **Inheritance:** `protected` members are useful for providing access to members that should be shared among related classes but not exposed to external code.
* **Example:**

    ```typescript
    class Person {
      protected name: string;

      constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
      }
    }

    class Employee extends Person {
      private department: string;

      constructor(name: string, department: string) {
        super(name);
        this.department = department;
      }

      public getEmployeeDetails(): string {
        return `${this.name} works in ${this.department}`; // name is accessible here.
      }
    }

    const employee = new Employee("Alice", "Engineering");
    console.log(employee.getEmployeeDetails()); // Output: Alice works in Engineering
    // console.log(employee.name); // Error: Property 'name' is protected and only accessible within class 'Person' and its subclasses.
    ```

**Summary Table**

| Modifier    | Within Class | Derived Class | Outside Class |
| :---------- | :----------- | :------------ | :------------ |
| `public`    | Yes          | Yes           | Yes           |
| `private`   | Yes          | No            | No            |
| `protected` | Yes          | Yes           | No            |

These access modifiers are crucial for writing maintainable and robust TypeScript code, allowing you to control the visibility of class members and enforce encapsulation principles.

## readonly

The `readonly` keyword in TypeScript classes is used to ensure that a property can only be assigned a value during its initialization, either at its declaration or within the constructor. After that, its value cannot be changed. This provides immutability for specific class properties.

Here's a breakdown of how `readonly` works in the context of TypeScript classes:

**1. Declaration and Initialization:**

* A `readonly` property must be initialized either at the point of its declaration or within the class's constructor.
* Once initialized, any attempt to reassign a value to the `readonly` property will result in a compile-time error.

**2. Immutability:**

* `readonly` ensures that the property's value remains constant after initialization. This is useful for properties that should not change throughout the object's lifetime.

**3. Reference Types:**

* For reference types (objects and arrays), `readonly` prevents reassignment of the reference itself. However, it does **not** prevent modifications to the object or array's internal properties or elements. To ensure deep immutability, extra steps are needed.

**Examples:**

```typescript
class Circle {
  readonly radius: number;
  readonly color?: string; //Optional readonly property

  constructor(radius: number, color?: string) {
    this.radius = radius;
    this.color = color;
  }

  getArea(): number {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

const myCircle = new Circle(5, "blue");

console.log(myCircle.radius); // Output: 5
console.log(myCircle.getArea()); //Output: 78.53981633974483

// myCircle.radius = 10; // Error: Cannot assign to 'radius' because it is a read-only property.

class Point {
  readonly coordinates: { x: number; y: number };

  constructor(x: number, y: number) {
    this.coordinates = { x, y };
  }
}

const myPoint = new Point(10, 20);
console.log(myPoint.coordinates.x); //Output: 10
// myPoint.coordinates = {x : 2, y:3}; //Error.
myPoint.coordinates.x = 30; //This is allowed, even though coordinates is readonly, because the internal properties of the object can still be changed.
console.log(myPoint.coordinates.x); //Output: 30
```

**Key Points:**

* `readonly` is a compile-time construct. It helps TypeScript enforce immutability during development.
* For reference types, `readonly` only makes the reference itself immutable, not the object or array's contents.
* `readonly` is commonly used for properties that represent configuration values, unique identifiers, or other data that should not change after initialization.
* `readonly` can be used with optional properties, as seen with the color property in the circle example.

## Overriding

Overriding in TypeScript classes allows a derived (child) class to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its base (parent) class. This is a core concept of inheritance and polymorphism.

Here's how to implement overriding in TypeScript:

**1. Define a Base Class:**

* Create a base class with a method that you want to override in the derived class.

**2. Create a Derived Class:**

* Extend the base class using the `extends` keyword.
* Define a method in the derived class with the same name and signature (parameters and return type) as the method in the base class.
* Use the `super` keyword to call the base class's method if needed.

**3. The `override` Keyword (TypeScript 4.3 and later):**

* TypeScript 4.3 introduced the `override` keyword, which explicitly indicates that a method is intended to override a base class method. It helps catch errors if you accidentally try to override a method that doesn't exist in the base class or if the signatures don't match.

**Example:**

```typescript
class Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Some generic sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  override makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Woof! Woof!");
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  override makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Meow!");
  }
}

const animal = new Animal();
const dog = new Dog();
const cat = new Cat();

animal.makeSound(); // Output: Some generic sound
dog.makeSound();    // Output: Woof! Woof!
cat.makeSound();    // Output: Meow!

// Example using super:

class Vehicle {
    start(): void {
        console.log("Vehicle starting");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    override start(): void {
        super.start(); //Calls the base class's start method.
        console.log("Car starting engine");
    }
}

const myCar = new Car();
myCar.start();
//Output:
//Vehicle starting
//Car starting engine
```

**Explanation:**

* The `Animal` class has a `makeSound()` method.
* The `Dog` and `Cat` classes extend `Animal` and override the `makeSound()` method with their specific implementations.
* When `dog.makeSound()` and `cat.makeSound()` are called, the overridden methods in the respective derived classes are executed.
* The example with `Vehicle` and `Car` shows how to use `super` to call the base class implementation before adding specialized logic.
* The `override` keyword is a safety net. If you misspell the method name or change the signature in the derived class, TypeScript will give you a compilation error, preventing potential runtime bugs.

**Important Notes:**

* The method signature (parameters and return type) in the derived class must match the method signature in the base class for overriding to work correctly.
* You can use the `super` keyword to call the base class's method from within the overridden method.
* Overriding allows for polymorphism, where objects of different derived classes can be treated as objects of the base class, and the appropriate overridden method will be called at runtime.

## Abstract Classes

In TypeScript, abstract classes serve as blueprints for other classes. They cannot be instantiated directly and are designed to be extended by derived classes. Here's a breakdown of their key characteristics and purpose:

**Key Concepts:**

* **Blueprint for Derived Classes:**
    * An abstract class defines a common structure and behavior for related classes.
    * It acts as a base class from which other classes inherit.
* **Cannot Be Instantiated:**
    * You cannot create an instance of an abstract class using the `new` keyword.
    * Their primary purpose is to be extended.
* **Abstract Methods:**
    * Abstract classes can contain abstract methods, which are methods without implementation.
    * Derived classes must provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.
    * This enforces a contract, ensuring that all derived classes have certain methods.
* **Concrete Methods and Properties:**
    * Abstract classes can also include concrete methods (methods with implementations) and properties.
    * This allows you to share common functionality among derived classes.

**Purpose and Benefits:**

* **Code Reusability:**
    * Abstract classes allow you to define common behavior that multiple derived classes can share, reducing code duplication.
* **Enforcing Structure:**
    * By defining abstract methods, you can ensure that derived classes implement essential functionality.
    * This promotes consistency and predictability in your codebase.
* **Polymorphism:**
    * Abstract classes facilitate polymorphism, allowing you to treat objects of different derived classes as objects of the abstract base class.

**Example:**

```typescript
abstract class Animal {
  constructor(public name: string) {}

  abstract makeSound(): void; // Abstract method

  move(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} is moving.`); // Concrete method
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name: string) {
    super(name);
  }

  makeSound(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} says: Woof!`);
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  constructor(name: string) {
    super(name);
  }

  makeSound(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} says: Meow!`);
  }
}

// let animal = new Animal("generic animal"); //Error: Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.

let dog = new Dog("Buddy");
let cat = new Cat("Whiskers");

dog.makeSound(); // Output: Buddy says: Woof!
cat.makeSound(); // Output: Whiskers says: Meow!
dog.move(); //Output: Buddy is moving.
```

In this example:

* `Animal` is an abstract class with an abstract `makeSound()` method and a concrete `move()` method.
* `Dog` and `Cat` are derived classes that extend `Animal` and provide their own implementations of `makeSound()`.

Abstract classes are a powerful tool for building robust and maintainable TypeScript applications.

## Singleton Class

A Singleton class in TypeScript (and other languages) is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. This ensures that only one instance of the class exists throughout the application's lifecycle, providing a global point of access to that instance.

Here's how to implement a Singleton class in TypeScript, along with explanations and considerations:

**Implementation:**

```typescript
class Singleton {
  private static instance: Singleton; // Static property to hold the single instance
  private constructor() {
    // Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation
  }

  public static getInstance(): Singleton {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = new Singleton();
    }
    return Singleton.instance;
  }

  // Add any other methods and properties here
  public someMethod(): void {
    console.log("Singleton method called");
  }

  public someProperty: string = "Singleton Property";
}

// Usage:
const instance1 = Singleton.getInstance();
const instance2 = Singleton.getInstance();

console.log(instance1 === instance2); // Output: true (both variables reference the same instance)

instance1.someMethod(); // Output: Singleton method called
console.log(instance2.someProperty); //Output: Singleton Property
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Private Static Instance:**
    * `private static instance: Singleton;` declares a static private property that will hold the single instance of the `Singleton` class. It's static so that it belongs to the class itself, not to any particular instance. It's private so that external code can't directly modify it.

2.  **Private Constructor:**
    * `private constructor() { ... }` makes the class constructor private. This prevents direct instantiation of the `Singleton` class using `new Singleton()`.

3.  **Static `getInstance()` Method:**
    * `public static getInstance(): Singleton { ... }` provides a static public method that acts as the sole entry point for obtaining the Singleton instance.
    * Inside the `getInstance()` method, it checks if `Singleton.instance` is already created. If not, it creates a new instance and assigns it to `Singleton.instance`.
    * It then returns the `Singleton.instance`.

4.  **Usage:**
    * All parts of the program that need to use the Singleton interact with it by calling the `Singleton.getInstance()` method. This guarantees that they are all using the same instance.
    * The comparison of instance1 and instance2 demonstrates that they are the same object.

**Use Cases:**

* **Logging:** A single logging instance to handle all application logs.
* **Configuration Management:** A single configuration object to hold application settings.
* **Database Connection:** A single database connection pool to manage database access.
* **Print Spooler:** To ensure only one print spooler is active.
* **Caching:** A single caching instance.

**Considerations:**

* **Global State:** Singletons introduce global state, which can make testing and debugging more challenging.
* **Tight Coupling:** Singletons can lead to tight coupling between different parts of your code.
* **Testability:** Singletons can make unit testing more difficult, as they introduce dependencies that are hard to mock or isolate.
* **Alternatives:** In some cases, dependency injection or other design patterns might be more appropriate than Singletons.
* **Lazy Initialization:** The example above uses lazy initialization, which means the instance is created only when it's first needed. This can be beneficial for performance if the instance is not always required.

While Singletons can be useful in certain scenarios, it's essential to consider their potential drawbacks and use them judiciously.
