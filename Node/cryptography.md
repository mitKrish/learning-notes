Encryption and hashing are both cryptographic techniques used to secure data, but they serve fundamentally different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here's a breakdown of each:

**Encryption**

* **Purpose:** To protect the **confidentiality** of data. The goal is to transform data into an unreadable format (ciphertext) so that only authorized parties with the correct decryption key can access the original data (plaintext).
* **Key Characteristic:** **Reversible**. Encrypted data can be converted back to its original form using a decryption key.
* **Process:** An encryption algorithm (cipher) is used along with a key to transform plaintext into ciphertext. The same key (in symmetric encryption) or a different but related key (in asymmetric encryption) is used for decryption.
* **Use Cases:**
    * Securing data in transit (e.g., HTTPS for web browsing, email encryption).
    * Protecting data at rest (e.g., encrypting files on a hard drive, database encryption).
    * Secure communication where only the sender and receiver should understand the message.
* **Types of Encryption:**
    * **Symmetric Encryption:** Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES, DES, 3DES). It's generally faster but requires a secure way to share the key.
    * **Asymmetric Encryption:** Uses two separate but mathematically linked keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption (e.g., RSA, ECC). The public key can be shared, but the private key must be kept secret. It's slower than symmetric encryption but simplifies key management.

**Hashing**

* **Purpose:** To ensure the **integrity** of data and for **authentication**. It creates a fixed-size "fingerprint" (hash value or message digest) of the input data. Any change to the original data, no matter how small, will result in a completely different hash value.
* **Key Characteristic:** **One-way (Irreversible)**. It is computationally infeasible to reverse a hash value back to its original input data.
* **Process:** A hash function takes an input (data of any size) and produces a fixed-size output (the hash value). The same input will always produce the same hash output.
* **Use Cases:**
    * **Password Storage:** Websites typically store hashed versions of passwords instead of the plaintext. When a user tries to log in, their entered password is hashed, and the result is compared to the stored hash.
    * **Data Integrity Verification:** Checking if a file has been altered during download or transmission. The hash of the original file can be compared to the hash of the received file.
    * **Digital Signatures:** Hashing is used to create a digest of a document, which is then digitally signed. This ensures both the authenticity and integrity of the document.
    * **Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin):** Hashing is a fundamental part of blockchain technology, used to link blocks of transactions securely.
* **Properties of Cryptographic Hash Functions:**
    * **Pre-image resistance:** It should be hard to find the original input given only the hash value.
    * **Second pre-image resistance:** It should be hard to find a different input that produces the same hash as a given input.
    * **Collision resistance:** It should be hard to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value. Strong cryptographic hash functions aim for high collision resistance.
* **Common Hashing Algorithms:** SHA-256, SHA-3, BLAKE2, MD5 (MD5 is now considered cryptographically weak and should not be used for security-sensitive applications).

**Key Differences Summarized:**

| Feature          | Encryption                                  | Hashing                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Goal** | Confidentiality                             | Integrity and Authentication                 |
| **Reversibility** | Reversible (using a key)                    | Irreversible (one-way function)              |
| **Output Size** | Typically the same size or larger than input | Fixed size, usually much smaller than input |
| **Key Usage** | Requires a key for both encryption/decryption | No key is used in the hashing process itself |
| **Main Use Cases**| Protecting data in transit and at rest      | Password storage, data integrity checks, digital signatures |

In essence, **encryption is about hiding information**, while **hashing is about creating a unique and verifiable representation of information**. They are both crucial tools in cryptography but serve distinct security needs. Sometimes, they are even used together to achieve both confidentiality and integrity. For example, a message might be encrypted for confidentiality, and a hash of the message could be included to ensure its integrity upon decryption.
