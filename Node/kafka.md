## Kafka

Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that enables you to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It's designed for high throughput, fault tolerance, and scalability. Let's delve into its core concepts and illustrate them with Node.js examples.

**Key Concepts**

* **Topics:**
    * A topic is a category or feed name to which records are published.
    * Think of it as a named stream of records.
* **Partitions:**
    * Topics are divided into partitions, which are ordered, immutable sequences of records.
    * Partitions allow for parallelism and scalability.
    * Each record within a partition is assigned a sequential ID called an offset.
* **Producers:**
    * Producers publish records to Kafka topics.
    * They can choose which partition to send records to (or let Kafka handle it).
* **Consumers:**
    * Consumers subscribe to Kafka topics and process the records.
    * Consumers can belong to consumer groups, which allow for parallel processing of partitions.
    * Each consumer within a group is assigned a subset of partitions.
* **Brokers:**
    * Kafka brokers are servers that store the data.
    * A Kafka cluster consists of multiple brokers.
* **ZooKeeper:**
    * ZooKeeper is used to manage and coordinate the Kafka brokers.
    * It handles tasks like leader election and configuration management.

**Node.js Examples**

We'll use the `kafkajs` library for interacting with Kafka from Node.js.

**1. Setting up Kafka and ZooKeeper (for local development):**

* You'll need a Kafka and ZooKeeper instance running. For local development, you can use Docker or download and run them directly.
* Docker compose example:
    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'
    services:
      zookeeper:
        image: 'bitnami/zookeeper:latest'
        ports:
          - '2181:2181'
        environment:
          - ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_LOGIN=yes
      kafka:
        image: 'bitnami/kafka:latest'
        ports:
          - '9092:9092'
        environment:
          - KAFKA_CFG_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper:2181
          - ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_LISTENER=yes
          - KAFKA_CFG_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://:9092
          - KAFKA_CFG_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://127.0.0.1:9092
        depends_on:
          - zookeeper
    ```
    * run `docker compose up -d`

**2. Installing `kafkajs`:**

```bash
npm install kafkajs
```

**3. Producer Example:**

```javascript
const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');

async function produce() {
  const kafka = new Kafka({
    clientId: 'my-producer',
    brokers: ['127.0.0.1:9092'], // Replace with your broker addresses
  });

  const producer = kafka.producer();

  await producer.connect();

  const message = {
    key: 'messageKey',
    value: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello, Kafka!' }),
  };

  await producer.send({
    topic: 'my-topic',
    messages: [message],
  });

  console.log('Message sent!');

  await producer.disconnect();
}

produce().catch(console.error);
```

**4. Consumer Example:**

```javascript
const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');

async function consume() {
  const kafka = new Kafka({
    clientId: 'my-consumer',
    brokers: ['127.0.0.1:9092'], // Replace with your broker addresses
  });

  const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'my-group' });

  await consumer.connect();
  await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'my-topic', fromBeginning: true });

  await consumer.run({
    eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
      console.log({
        topic,
        partition,
        offset: message.offset,
        value: JSON.parse(message.value.toString()),
      });
    },
  });
}

consume().catch(console.error);
```

**Explanation:**

* **Producer:**
    * We create a Kafka producer instance.
    * We connect to the Kafka cluster.
    * We create a message object with a key and value.
    * We send the message to the specified topic.
    * We disconnect the producer.
* **Consumer:**
    * We create a Kafka consumer instance and specify a consumer group ID.
    * We connect to the Kafka cluster.
    * We subscribe to the topic.
    * We start the consumer, and for each message, we log the topic, partition, offset, and message value.
    * We use fromBeginning: true, so that the consumer reads all messages from the beginning of the topic.

**Best Practices:**

* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your producer and consumer code.
* **Configuration:** Externalize Kafka configuration (broker addresses, topic names, etc.).
* **Serialization:** Use efficient serialization formats (e.g., Avro, Protobuf) for your messages.
* **Consumer Groups:** Use consumer groups to scale your consumer applications.
* **Monitoring:** Monitor your Kafka cluster and applications for performance and errors.
* **Idempotent Producers:** For at-least-once delivery guarantees, configure your producers for idempotency.
* **Transactions:** Use Kafka transactions for exactly-once processing in complex scenarios.
* **Partitions:** Properly plan the number of partitions for your topics based on your throughput requirements.
* **Security:** If working in a production environment, enable security features such as TLS encryption and authentication.
* **Compression:** Use compression to reduce network bandwidth usage.
* **Offset Management:** Understand how Kafka manages offsets and configure your consumers accordingly.
* **Replication factor:** For production, setup your topics with a replication factor greater than 1.
